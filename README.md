Hi Everybody,

This is still a work in progress. As I started working FT at MS I decided to reduce
coverage of this project. However, the purpose of this project was to integrate with
Polygon's API to retrieve Option Financial Data and Build out a set of OOO based programs
that allow for rapid manipulation of portfolios and consequently portfolio optimization using
Stochastic Calculus and other Financial Engineering methods. I plan to pick this back up when
I have more time.
