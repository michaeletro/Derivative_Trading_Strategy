Trading Strategy

This is an Coding Project that uses Polygon's API to be able to retrieve and parse market data.

This is achieved by using Polygon as the API source for data. We implement the architecture by the use 
of inheritance polymorphism. We make a single API request object to our
server and then extract the data into its respective financial object.

The goal now is to expand functionality of this to be able to build
out a portfolio strategy and test its long term backtests on the market.

With the completion of that we can now test different portfolio strategies and expand
the current coding set to include some kind of statistical, stochastic ML
type of forecasting given data.
